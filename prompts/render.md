This project is a simple 2D tile-based game.
The core game logic is already implemented in c.
What we need to do now is implement a renderer using SDL.
Then render function should accept a GameState and render it to the screen.

Let's start with a simple harness that just initializes some hard-coded game state (game_init.c) and renders it.
